## A year in review

2020 has ended thankfully. It's been a confusing and difficult year
trying to navigate life during the pandemic. A lot of plans I made at
the start of the year changed because of it. However, it was not all
bad, this summer I was able to do a lot of travelling thanks to working
online at RBC during my 8-month co-op. I also completing my 3^rd^ year
of Sheridan College and I'm happy to finally be transitioning into my
last and final year of school.

## 2020 accomplishments

2020 saw me accomplish the following

1.  I learnt new technologies (Kuberentes, Docker, Jenkins) and got a
    look at what giant software project look like

2.  Able to play a lot more with the cloud during personal projects and
    hackathons

3.  Took part in 3 hackathons and finished 3^rd^ in a hackathon and won
    \$250

4.  Got accepted into Sheridans Thesis program with ed sykes as my prof

5.  Completed my final 3^rd^ year semester and will be heading into my
    final year of school

6.  Raised \$12,000 for a hackathon (hackville.io, check it out) and
    helped develop hackademics.club and hackville.io website

7.  Attempted to contribute to an open-source project

### Learning New Tech

I think the biggest accomplish this year was having my eyes opened up to
the different technology's that companies are using on the backend to
develop platform on the cloud. At RBC we were developing a next
generation pipeline for bank developers to deploy their applications to
the cloud. We were using a managed Kuberentes service that Azure
provides (AKS). The 8-months at RBC shown me what a team of senior cloud
developers are capable of as well. I would like to say that while at RBC
I saw the mythical 10x developer for the first time. I was amazed at the
amount of productivity they provided the team and how fast they allowed
our team to move and it was a real inspiration for me and a goal to
achieve for in my next co-op and full-time job.

I was able to take some of the things I learnt from RBC and apply it to
some of my own personal projects as well. For wasmcompute I learnt about
AWS and used terraform to build my infrastructure on it. I used my
knowledge learnt from RBC and installed 3^rd^ party dependencies using
docker during development. Finally, I was also able to use GCP (Google
cloud platform) to host a website on a VPS for Ruhacks.

### Participating and winning Hackathons

Along with RuHacks, I also participated in 2 other hackathons. The first
being Starter hacks which happened at the start of 2020. There I
developed a chrome extension that used Alexa skills to transfer a
youtube video a user was watching on their phone to their computer. My
final hack for the year was RBC Amp Hacks where my team placed 3^rd^ for
our idea of creating a mapping application that would show immigrants
where they could move to in Canada while being close to their job and
culture.

### Finishing School

Aside from going to some hackathons and completing my co-op, I also
finished my 3^rd^ year at Sheridan College. This last semester had me
submit a thesis proposal which luckily got accepted. I'm excited to
announce that this year I will be researching stateful serverless
functions and solutions that you can use on the market today.

To go along with my school accomplishments, I also was promoted to Vice
president at the school club I am apart of called Hackademics. I have
been helping plan Hackville this past year and helped raise \$12,000 in
funds for it.

### Open source

Finally, I attempted to try and contribute to an open-source rust web
library called tide. I needed subdomain routing support inside of
wasmcompute so I added in the functionality myself. I posted an issue
and implemented a solution. However, it never went through sadly. I'm
not sad about the situation. I needed support for the functionality
anyways. I was just a bit disappointed that the maintainers weren't
fully clear with what they wanted.

## 2020 failures

However, not everything was sunshine and rainbows this year. I also had
trouble completing the following goals:

1.  I Failed to get wasmcompute fully operational

2.  I Failed RBC amplify interview very very badly

3.  It took too long for me to figure out my life during the pandemic

4.  I Failed at keeping a consistent workout schedule

### Wasmcompute

Wasmcompute was meant to be my big project that I would show off to
companies for summer 2021 and it was supposed to be fully operational
with ways to change it over time. However, that never came to be. You
can read more about the difficulties I had with the project over on my
devlog. Hopefully I am able to get it to some sort of operational state
before I start applying to full time jobs next January.

### Bad Interviews

After finishing 3^rd^ at RBC AmpHacks I was put on the fast track for
interviews for the amplify program at RBC. Sadly, when the interview
came around, I wasn't prepared and failed it in spectacular fashion. I
spent 10 minutes on the first question, when the interview was 30
minutes long with 5 questions, guess I didn't understand what they were
asking. I was pretty sad about my performance and wasn't surprised when
I got the rejection letter in my email. However, when one door closes,
another opens and I'm sure to learn from this experience. I believe the
reason why I performed so poorly was because I was still getting used to
the pandemic and not my usual self. Since then I have taken steps to
talk more with my peers and move around more so that it won't happen
again.

### Pandemic stuff

Figuring life out for me this year was hard. I've only just started
feeling normal working at home all the time. Finding normalcy during a
pandemic is hard. To make me feel more normal I realized I needed to NOT
sit for 16 hours a day working on my personal and work projects but to
get up and move around as well as talk to friends and family. You can
read my 2021 plans for how I am making sure that the pandemic doesn't
affect my life 2 years in a row.

Finally, plain and simple, I wasn't able to keep my workout schedule
that I had planned. Mainly because I'm not used to working out anymore
and all the gyms are closed. I have plans to make sure 2020 doesn't
repeat itself

## 2021 Plans

2021 is here and it's a BIG year for me and I'm not going to let the
pandemic ruin it again. These are the following goals I have for 2021,
ranked from most to least important:

1.  Pass my defense for my thesis on stateful serverless technologies
    (with the cherry on top being my paper being published)

2.  Post at least 23 blog posts this year with least half of them being
    on serverless technologies

3.  Improve my personal website and make it into a blog. Start a mailing
    list for it that has at least 1 person in it.

4.  Get a co-op that focuses on Cloud, Devops, backend development or
    fullstack development

5.  Get a full-time job that focuses on Cloud, Devops, backend
    development or fullstack development

6.  Graduate from Sheridan College with a GPA that passes (im fucking
    done with sheridan)

7.  Get my Sheridan Creativity certificate (im fucking done with
    Sheridan)

8.  Host a successful hackathon

9.  Pass hackademics club onto a new generation

10. Get Wasmcompute operational

11. Keeping a consistent activity and workout schedule

12. Learn a little bit more of Russian (able to keep basic
    converstation)

### Explanation

This year is focused around 4 main goals:

1.  Completing school and wrapping up my involvement in school clubs

2.  Getting a positive co-op experience and landing a job

3.  Putting serious effort into building my personal brand

4.  Get/Stay fit and learn a new language

Completing school is obviously the most important thing here and I can't
describe how excited I am to be done with it. I love Sheridan, it's has
allowed me to grow and get a degree (something I thought I would never
be able to do) but at this point it will have been here for 6 years and
I want out. I'm excited to make a thesis, I know it's going to be a lot
of work, but I think doing one will help me develop the areas I have the
most trouble with right now (writing and research). With the help of my
research professor Ed Sykes, I hope I can improve my ability to write
and research topics effectively and the skills will transfer to my
professional career.

With school ending its finally time to find a full-time job. I've
honestly been kind of scared about this. I have found that a lot of my
co-op experience have always been great but missed the mark in some
areas. I've found 4 different co-op jobs at 4 different locations so I'm
not afraid I won't find a job, but I am afraid it maybe a job that is
not a good fit for me. I'll be sure to apply wisely.

I've heard a lot from a bunch of hiring managers and co-op advisors over
the 5 years I've been at school that having a personal brand is super
important. However, I never found the time to actually do it. This year
that changes. I've seen people be super successfully just by doing
things their interested in and sharing it with others. I want to do that
too and there is no better time to do it with all of the research I will
be doing for my thesis. Although I don't want to start advertising my
articles until I know they are better. This year I put serious effort
becoming that dude that knows about serverless and the cloud!

Finally, were still in a pandemic and I still can't go to the gym but
I'm tired of sitting for up to 16 hours a day. This year I'm going to
try and stay fit at home and do at least 30 minutes of hard exercise at
least 3 times a week. I've also purchased a VR headset and am planning
to use it to give me a break from sitting in my chair all day. I think
this is a solid plan and am excited to see how it works in the new year.

## Reflection

Although I am a programmer it doesn't mean all my goals need to be
programming related. This year I find that I have a lot of personal
goals that I need to accomplish especially now with the pandemic and
needing to find a co-op and full-time employment. I believe the goals
I've sent are maintainable and attainable. I'm excited to how I will
perform for 2021.
