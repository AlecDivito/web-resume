## Disclaimer

This is my first blog post for my website. As such, it will be where I
write down my plans for what I want for this blog to achieve. If you are
not interested in the meta of this blog or about me then I suggest you
don't read this post. If you have come to my website for more technical
topics, I recommend you look over my devlog. It contains technical
projects with some technical talk as well as a reflection on how a
project went or how I think a project is going. Anyways, back to the
post...

## So, I made a thing...

Though, to be honest I've been **"making it"** for 2 year now and will
continue to work on it into the future. I've updated this website one
more time so that it looks prettier and support more of the
functionalities I want in a personal website/blog.

I did this with some help from my girlfriend
[Valeriia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/val-z/) [Zub](https://www.val-z.com/);
a designer who helped me work through the redesign so that I don't screw
it up again using blue on red as my primary and secondary colours. You
can read about it and my other design
decisions on my [devlog](/devlog) page about
[building this website](/devlog/website-update-1).

After completing the redesign, I took some comments from the peanut gallery
(friends and family) and everyone has been expressing how much more they
like the update. I'm happy with it too and hope it is a step forward
for my career and personal brand development.

## Step forward?

This is a step forward because up until now I've felt as though I have
been lacking or neglecting important skills that I believe are essential
for a career in technology. Skills like writing, documenting,
researching and marketing projects as well as yourself.

To be more precise, these are the long-term goals I have for this
website:

1.  Become a better writer
2.  Become a better researcher
3.  Improve my documentation and my ability to document
4.  Learn how to pick better and more attainable goals yearly
5.  Track my personal projects and interests effectively
6.  Create a personal brand
7.  Become very knowledgeable in a sub field of computer science (most likely serverless)
8.  Learn different technologies/tools and document my findings

I know the website right now isn't perfect for blogging. It is more of a
personal portfolio and resume website for the time being. But like any
application, it will grow with more time I put into it. I want to align
the growth of the blog with the development progression of my web
assembly serverless platform, [wasmcompute](https://wasmcompute.com/). I
hope that all the features that I add to the website like commenting and
searching will be supported through the
[wasmcompute](https://wasmcompute.com/) platform.

## What content will be covered?

The content that will be covered in this blog will mostly focus on
computer science topics in cloud computing and practical use cases for
them. For 2021 especially expect a heavy focus on Serverless computing,
stateful distributed systems, tutorials on today's serverless systems
and frameworks and reviews on their performance. These are the main
topics that I will be covering for my thesis in my program at Sheridan
College, [Mobile Computing](https://academics.sheridancollege.ca/programs/bachelor-computer-science-mobile-computing).

I'll also be covering personal topics that I'm interested in, such as
what's going on in my life and personal improvements I've made to my
life. One such example would be an article about the club at my school
I'm apart of called [Hackademics](https://www.hackademics.club/) where
we are planning [Hackville](https://hackville.io/); our clubs yearly
hackathon. Another could be about researching how to stay healthy as a
computer science student and professional during Covid-19 and what are
some ways I'm staying healthy.

## How often will content be posted?

Expect new articles at least once every other week with an aim for one
article a week with breaks here and there (exams and vacations). I just
want to try and keep a consistent schedule that will get me into the
habit of writing and presenting my research regularly. No longer should
a project be worked on for +1 year without not a single person knowing
about it. After I finish school in December 2021 I'll try and post more
regularly and make a bigger push on building my personal brand but for
now I'll just be practicing my writing and will be happy if this helps
me get a job or a co-op.

## Conclusion

Growth is a fact of life and I hope this website is the next step in my
career. By logging more of my personal opinions and development
practices I hope to not only build more of my own personal brand, but I
also hope that the content I write about and share help readers in the
future.
