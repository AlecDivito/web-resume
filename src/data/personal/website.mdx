## Overview

This website was created to act as a resume for my skills and hobbies for anyone
who is interested. The website is the starting of a project that could become
a blog or a place to put my school and self studies. The hardest part of any
project is starting it and this my start.

## Goals

1. Act as a second resume
2. Look decent for a Full Stack standard (not UI/UX)
3. Show off completed school and personal projects

I wanted to make something that was easily extendable, looked good and was easy to manage. It also
had to have a layout that was easy to read on mobile, tablet and desktop platforms.
The final goal was to make sure that it advertised my accomplishments and
projects that I have completed and am proud of as well as give a glimps of what
I'm currently working on.

## Technologies

The site was build with Gatsby<sup>[[2](#gatsby)]</sup> because it allowed me to
use React to generate a static site. I really enjoyed using it and felt right at
home because of how heavily Gatsby uses React and it's component system. That's
the main reason why it was chosen over other solution's that are out on the market
today (ex. Hugo)

Javascript was used instead of my usually choice of Typescript. This was mainly
because this is my first project using Gatsby and I didn't find out there was a
plugin that allowed me to compile the project with typescript. Overall I believe
this was a poor choice and regret it. Typescript is superior to Javascript in
every way and using React without types doesn't feel right. Proptypes do help
a little but they do not compare to the ability in typescript to quickly map
out an interface and get a compile time exception about an incorrect type. Though
this was my first time using Proptypes in a actual project so I may not know all
the tips and tricks.

To style I used SCSS and focused on using some parts of the BEM methodology.

## Design/Development Process

This project has been on and off again for at least 1 year at this point.
In that time there have been many designs focusing on single paged layout's
but none of them were ever panned out. What really held me back we're my designs and
planning. This time I decided to take the time to just draw out some basic ideas
as well as define a small sitemap that would cover all the sections of the site.
After spending 30 minutes of drawing and thinking what content I wanted on each
page I ended up with these drawings:

<div class="image--grid">
    <props.images.design_index_page alt="Initial design for home page"/>
    <props.images.design_about_page alt="Initial design for about page"/>
    <props.images.design_projects_page alt="Initial design for projects page"/>
    <props.images.design_work_page alt="Initial design for work page"/>
    <props.images.design_contact_page alt="Initial design for contact page"/>
    <props.images.design_nav_component alt="Initial design for the nav component"/>
</div>

After quickly finishing my layouts I got to work and used this small color palette
to color the screen:

<h4>Old Primary Colors</h4>
<div>
    <span class="color--square old-primary-1"></span>
</div>
<h4>Old Accent Colors</h4>
<div>
    <span class="color--square old-accent-1"></span>
</div>
<h4>Old Shades</h4>
<div>
    <span class="color--square old-shade-1"></span>
    <span class="color--square old-shade-2"></span>
</div>

Using a simple palette allowed me to not spend much time on coloring the site so
I was able to spend more time on styling the components and live functionalities
live the navigation bar. The final designs for the projects and index page look
as such:

<div class="image--grid">
    <props.images.old_index_page alt="first vision of the home page" />
    <props.images.old_about_page alt="first vision of the about page" />
    <props.images.old_personal_page alt="first vision of the projects page" />
    <props.images.old_work_page alt="first vision of the work page" />
    <props.images.old_contact_page alt="first vision of the contact page" />
    <props.images.old_nav_component alt="first vision of the active nav component" />
</div>

Now, to be franck, I thought this looked pretty good. Yeah there were some super
bright colors and the accent color looked pretty bad but I thought I had done a
good job on it. Then I let other people see. So I changed it.

The first part of the site that was changed is colors. After reading through
refactoring UI<sup>[[1](#refactoringui)]</sup> blog post on how important color
is in an application as well as how important it is to have different shades. This
lead me to actually spend some time actually coming up with a good color palette.
With lots of colors to choose from, These are the colors and shades I came up with:

<h3>Primary Color</h3>
<div>
    <span class="color--square primary-1"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-2"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-3"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-4"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-5"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-6"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-7"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-8"></span>
    <span class="color--square primary-9"></span>
</div>

<h3>Accent Color</h3>
<div>
    <span class="color--square accent-1"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-2"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-3"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-4"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-5"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-6"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-7"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-8"></span>
    <span class="color--square accent-9"></span>
</div>

<h3>Shades</h3>
<div>
    <span class="color--square shade-1"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-2"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-3"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-4"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-5"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-6"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-7"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-8"></span>
    <span class="color--square shade-9"></span>
</div>

Already this looks better then the older shades, not only do we have more selection
to pick from but we can also give different colors to different components on the page.
Once the updated colors were picked I got what the site looks like today.

## Difficulties

There were no big difficulties that were faced during this project, on design
and learning pains. There were a lot of mistake's I made initial because I
didn't know very well how to use Gatsby so I had to read the documentation and
look at helpful tutorials.

The hardest part of this project was properly setting up the markdown to HTML
converter and properly setting up the filesystem so it pointed at all of my data
instead of the default pictures. Again all of these issues were solved as I learned
the platform more.

## Project Status

Is a resume ever done? No, so this website is never done but that's ok.
Overall the initial structure and design for the website is at a completed stage
that I am happy with. If I extend the site or my web design skills improve I may
look at updating the look.

## What's Next

Expanding the content on the website would be my first goal for what's to come.
A resume website doesn't add a lot to anyone's life, so turning it into a place
to congregate my thoughts, projects, tutorials would be my first move at improving
this site.

What's next could be boiled down to 2 points:

1. Write blog content (in the form of notes and tutorials)
2. Small redesign to focus more on content instead of my resume

Now is a better time then any as I will be back in school for 2 more years (as
of writing this in 2019). There is no better time then right now to start.

## Reflections

As I reflect on this project I think it already shows that the biggest hangup for
the project was design. Using a tool like Figma<sup>[[6](#figma)]</sup> before
jumping straight into the coding would have allowed me to code this website once
and not need to make multiple small changes to it over time.

I'm also not happy about the way I sorted out my styles and I feel as though I
maybe repeating myself quite a bit in the style department. I think a way to
improve this is to look at some css framework as well as reworking how my pages
are layed out.

Although I may complain about how I was slowed down by my lack of design prototyping,
I can say with confidence that I really like the look of my site. A lot of my
design friends nit pick it but everyone else not in design say it looks great
which is awesome. This really motivated to keep better tabs on my projects and
document anything I create. I can't wait to add more content to my website :)
