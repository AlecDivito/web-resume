## Overview

Rustbitmap is a small rust library used to read, write and edit bitmaps.

## Goals

1. Get used to reading and implementing specification documents
2. Ability write and read in most types of bitmaps
3. Testing
4. Deploy the crate
5. Use no dependencies

## Technologies
 
Rust was chosen because I am learning it in my free time and I really like it's
types system. I also believe it to be the future after it reaches an muchirtiy.
It's include package manager make's working with it a lot of fun as well. The
main reason why I didn't code this in C++ was because rust would be less code,
cleaner code, and the best part is that it would be safe.

I added continuous integration as well as tests to make sure the functions I
implemented work.

## Difficulties

The biggest hurdle was reading and writing files with a different bitcount (or depth count).
It also took me awhile to get my head around bitcount and depth

Another difficulty I faced was implementing image resizing. Nearest neighbor was
simple but when jumping up to bilinear and bicubic resizing I initially had
difficult understanding the concept. Although after watching some helpful
video's by computerphile on Youtube and reading some online articles it became
clear to me and I was able to implement it in a couple of hours.

One of the smaller issues when implementing bicubic was it's tendency to sometimes
over or under shoot it's possible range of values overflowing the bit. I ran into
this issue for a day and it took a couple of hours to figure out what was going
wrong.

## Project Status

This project is done. It works for most bitmaps found in the wild now-a-days
(which isn't common).

## Results

This is all about images and bitmaps so why don't we make some and talk about
the size of them. Lets start off with gradients and move on from there. Using the
code below we can expand a 3-by-3 cube by 10000% (300-by-300):

```Rust
extern crate rustbitmap;

use rustbitmap::{BitMap, Rgba};

fn main() {
    let pixels = vec![Rgba::rgb(255, 0, 0), Rgba::rgb(127, 0, 127), Rgba::rgb(0, 0, 255),
                      Rgba::rgb(127, 127, 0), Rgba::white(), Rgba::rgb(0, 0, 127),
                      Rgba::rgb(0, 255, 0), Rgba::rgb(0, 127, 0), Rgba::rgb(0, 127, 127)];
    let mut nearest_neighbor = BitMap::create(3, 3, pixels.clone()).unwrap();
    let mut bilinear = BitMap::create(3, 3, pixels.clone()).unwrap();
    let mut bicubic = BitMap::create(3, 3, pixels.clone()).unwrap();

    nearest_neighbor.fast_resize_by(125.0).unwrap();
    bilinear.resize_by(125.0).unwrap();
    bicubic.slow_resize_by(125.0).unwrap();

    nearest_neighbor.simplify_and_save_as("gradient_nearest_neighbor.bmp").unwrap();
    bilinear.simplify_and_save_as("gradient_bilinear.bmp").unwrap();
    bicubic.simplify_and_save_as("gradient_bicubic.bmp").unwrap();
}
```

Produces images like these:

<div class="image--grid">
    <props.images.gradient_nearest_neighbor caption="Nearest Neighbor (300x300, 45.7KB)" alt="nearest neighbor gradient" />
    <props.images.gradient_bilinear caption="Bilinear (300x300, 270.1KB)" alt="bilinear gradient" />
    <props.images.gradient_bicubic caption="Bicubic (300x300, 270.1KB)" alt="bicubic gradient" />
</div>

We can also read in images so why don't we do that. I have a source image and let's
resize it to

<div class="image--center">
    <props.images.example caption="source image (640x450, 864.1KB)" alt="flower" />
</div>

Using the code:

```Rust
extern crate rustbitmap;

use rustbitmap::{BitMap};

fn main() {
    let mut nearest_neighbor = BitMap::read("example.bmp").unwrap();
    let mut bilinear = BitMap::read("example.bmp").unwrap();
    let mut bicubic = BitMap::read("example.bmp").unwrap();

    nearest_neighbor.fast_resize_by(0.25).unwrap();
    bilinear.resize_by(0.25).unwrap();
    bicubic.slow_resize_by(0.25).unwrap();

    nearest_neighbor.simplify_and_save_as("picture_nearest_neighbor.bmp").unwrap();
    bilinear.simplify_and_save_as("picture_bilinear.bmp").unwrap();
    bicubic.simplify_and_save_as("picture_bicubic.bmp").unwrap();
}
```

<div class="image--grid">
    <props.images.picture_nearest_neighbor caption="Nearest Neighbor (460x113, 54.3KB)" alt="nearest neighbor gradient" />
    <props.images.picture_bilinear caption="Bilinear (460x113, 54.3KB)" alt="bilinear gradient" />
    <props.images.picture_bicubic caption="Bicubic (460x113, 54.3KB)" alt="bicubic gradient" />
</div>

## What's Next

Adding some support for compiling the library down to webassembly. One of my
interests is being able to share code across code bases. I have attempted this
and am currently looking at a way of implementing it.

If and when I can compile it down to web assembly, I'll be posting a live demo
here to be for readers to use and test it out inside of they're browser.

## Reflections

This library is over designed and isn't usable right off the shelf, but it is
my first publicly available library. I think adding in the bitmap editing features
was a bit overkill but on the bright side I was able to implement image resizing
for linear, bilinear and bicubic interpolation.

I decided to challenge myself and setup a continuous pipeline using travis.ci
which was also really cool. From now on I want to always have a way for my applications
to be continuously tested and deployed.

One thing I would want to improve is the lack of traits used in my code. I believe
my code could have been better if I added that in.

I threw away a lot of my code but I had an better understanding of my problem and
what I needed to accomplish after prototyping. I feel as though my code

To be honest this project was just a fun small little project to help me get
more comfortable with rust's low level and to actually deploy it to a package
registry which I did and for that I'm happy. This project accomplished it's final
goal, I hope my next project is easily able to out shine this one.
