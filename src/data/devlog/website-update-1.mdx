## Overview

My personal portfolio has now been online for a little over 2 years now
and was initially created to showcase my skills and hobbies for anyone
interested to visit. The first post set and reviewed the initial goals,
technologies, design, development process and difficulties of the
project. This second post will review the what the first design
succeeded and failed in then review the new choices that have been made
for the websites update.

## Reviewing Goals

When I initially created my portfolio, I set out to create a website
that would look decent and work as a second resume. I also referenced
that I plan on making this website more of a blog and adding content
about school projects and self-interests. The website was meant to be
easily extendable, updateable and show case all of my accomplishments.
So how did I do? Overall, it was a failure. Let's, review the facts.

### Facts

Overall, I found that the website looked good and that most people
*without* a design background enjoyed the design and reviewing the
material on the site.

However...

After updating the website every so often for 2 years I can say that the
information found here was always super stale and never included up to
date information. I found the way I laid out the project files, markdown
content and data (which were mostly just JSON files) made it hard to
update the website quickly because I had duplicate data in 2-3 different
places.

Designers who viewed my pervious website ***did not approve*** that I
used a very saturated blue as my main color and a very saturated red as
my accent. They also didn't understand why I had "snow" on my landing
page. That was actually talked about the most when anyone visited my
website. I've removed it as it seems like no one really loved it. They
also mentioned poor text hierarchy and a bad font choice (now I
know that impact is not the best font to use).

Finally, the website was very time consuming to deploy. I currently
publish it by pushing the built website content to a different
repository on GitHub and GitHub pages deploys the website. This isn't
the best way to publish changes however, but it's been working for me,
so I've kept the practice up. This ~~will~~ must be changed in the
coming months.

## New Goals

After going over the goals from the initial development of this website
and the reviews from the designers, it is clear a new design and project
structure was need. The website has been left to rot for the past 2
years (2018-2020) and only accomplished being a second resume by a bare
minimum. To solve these past failures, I've made a collection of short
term and long-term goals that I hope this website can achieve.

This update will be focusing on solving my short-term goals, and the
update solves most of them. However, the long-term goals will be
implemented during the year of 2021.

### Short term

1.  Update primary and accent colors
2.  Add a page for blog content
3.  Modify the project page
4.  Change the about page to include more professional, personal information
5.  Change the style of the Landing page
6.  Update the layout of data.

### Long term

1.  Move data points, content and deployment to a third party service (using [wasmcompute](http://wasmcompute.com/))
2.  Post regular content about my projects and research topics/interests
3.  Share posts on multiple platforms and create a social persona
4.  Track number of visits to the website

## Design/Development Process

Before starting development this time around, I spent time preparing a
prototype of the updated website with my girlfriend and designer
[Valeriia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/val-z/)
[Zub](https://www.val-z.com/). We started out by talking together about
what I wanted the website to be (which is more of a blog) and creating a
list of things I wanted to change about the current website (see short
term goals). After listing them, I began working on the update. I
searched for inspiration by looking at other blogs and portfolios I had
found over the past year that I liked to take inspiration from.

I took "*inspirations*" from 2 websites. [joshwcomeau.com](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/), and [taniarascia.com](https://www.taniarascia.com/)

### Design Process

After the research was done and we knew roughly what we wanted, we
started prototyping and iterated through a couple of new designs for the
landing page.

</span>

After iterating over a handful of prototypes we finally found one design
we both liked and started copying information from my current website
over to provide more of a concert look and feel over a couple of
different pages.

<span>
<props.images.prototype alt="Prototype showing off how the application would look" caption="Prototype showing off design" />
</span>

I was super happy with the progress we made together and thought the new
website design was starting to look promising. I was a bit sad that the
entire website style was being updated but thought that if this new
design would be implemented it would be a big improvement. I dove into
the code and converting the prototype into website. In total, the entire
design process took around 12 hours to fully complete.

    <props.images.mobile_v3 alt="third version of alec divitos portfolio mobile index page" caption="third version" />
</div>

##### Desktop Home Page

    <props.images.index_v3 alt="third version of alec divitos portfolio desktop index page" caption="third version" />
</div>

##### Desktop About Page

    <props.images.about_v1 alt="second version of alec divitos portfolio desktop about page" caption="third version" />
</div>

##### Desktop Project Page

    <props.images.project_v2 alt="third version of alec divitos portfolio desktop projects page" caption="third version" />
</div>

### Development Process

The overall development time for updating the website was about 3 days
of programming (which equated to about 20 hours of programming). This
included making mock data that would be used as the blog posts and
deciding on what type of meta data should be displayed on the website.

I found that I refactored the redesign of the website twice. Once to
reduce the number of random css classes found on all of the pages by
creating general react components. The second refactor was improving the
graphql queries and updating meta data found in some of my mdx files.

One change I did without creating a prototype was adding in the devlog
page. I didn't want to mix up my project posts with my blog posts, thus
decided to create a new page. Overall, I'm happy with how both pages
cover unique content.

## Difficulties and Future Changes

I believe that there are more changes that need to be done to the
website. Currently, there is no paging, searching or filtering that can
be done on the devlog or blog pages. The home page also contains
duplicate information that can be found on the blog and devlog pages.
The home page should be updated to only contain the newest posts and
other announcements.

The about page should include some more details about my professional
ability and history. I'm planning on removing any professional
information from the home page once I have enough content for the blog
and devlog.

## Reflection

The update is a huge life quality of life change and puts me one step
closer to having a blog that I'm happy about. Though the amount of work
to get here has been quite a lot I believe it's a step in the right
direction. Over the course of the update, I've found that writing takes
just as much time as programming (if not more).

In the next couple of months, I plan on adding more content and once
that is done, add more functionalities. I'm excited to see how the
website.
